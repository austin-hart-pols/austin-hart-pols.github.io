I am Associate Professor of Politics, Governance, and Economics at American University. I am a political scientist focusing on comparative mass politics (voting, elections, campaigns), data analytics, and experiments. My current research develops a new framework for studying retrospective voting. I have written two books, *Quality Control* (2023) and *Economic Voting* (2016), both published by Cambridge University Press.

I teach courses in research design, data analytics, and quantitative methodology at the graduate and undergraduate levels. I also oversee the Research and Professional Methods curriculum at SIS. To date, I have planned, staffed, and delivered roughly 300 graduate courses in research methods.
