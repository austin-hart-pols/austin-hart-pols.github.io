I am an Associate Professor in the Dept of Politics, Governance, and Economics at American University. My research focuses on comparative mass politics and retrospective voting. I have written two books on these topics, *Quality Control* (2023) and *Economic Voting* (2016), both published by Cambridge University Press. My current project develops a new theoretical and methodological framework for studying the cognitive foundations of retrospective voting.  

I teach graduate courses in research design, data analytics, and quantitative methodology. I also oversee the Research and Professional Methods curriculum at SIS. To date, I have planned and staffed roughly 300 graduate classes in research methods.
