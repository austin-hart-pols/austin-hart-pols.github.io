I am Associate Professor of Politics, Governance, and Economics at American University. I am a political scientist focusing on comparative mass politics (voting, elections, campaigns) as well as statistical and experimental methods. My current research develops a new theoretical and methodological framework for studying retrospective voting. I am the author of two books on retrospective voting, both with Cambridge University Press.

I teach courses in quantitative statistical methods, research design, and data analysis at the graduate and undergraduate levels. I also serve as Coordinator of Research and Professional Methods. I have planned, staffed, and delivered roughly 300 graduate courses to date.
