I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Politics, Governance, and Economics at American University. My substantive research focuses on comparative mass politics and voting behavior survey. Some of this work focuses on the U.S. and/or Mexico; some is broadly comparative. I also work on designs for laboratory and survey experiments and questions of external validity in behavioral research.

In addition to peer-reviewed articles, I have written two books on retrospective voting--the phenomenon of citizens registering their appraisals of past performance in their judgment of incumbents. The most recent book, *Quality Control*, develops a new theoretical and methodological framework for studying the cognitive foundations of retrospective voting. 

I teach graduate courses in research design, data analytics, and quantitative methodology. I also oversee the Research and Professional Methods curriculum at the School of International Service. To date, I have planned and staffed roughly 300 graduate classes in research methods.
