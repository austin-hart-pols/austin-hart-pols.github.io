### courses
I teach graduate-level courses in research methodology, data analytics, and statistical analysis. For example:

- SIS 600: Stats and Methods I
- SIS 750: Stats and Methods II
- SIS 750: Data Analysis (visit our [course on github](https://github.com/SIS-data-analysis))
- SIS 806: Quantitative Methods in IR

### supervising
I am happy to supervise undergraduate, master's degree, or Ph.D. research in any area of mass politics, voting behavior, or public opinion. 

In recent years I have supervised master's degree research and advised doctoral dissertation research on topics including trust in government in urban India, inequality and demand for democracy in Africa, partisan-motivated reasoning and conceptualizations of "democracy," and more.

### hiring tutors and TAs
I am always looking to hire good tutors and/or TAs for SIS 600, our introductory graduate course in statistics and research methods. TAs work directly with a faculty member. Tutors work through the Math/Stat Tutoring Lab and provide dedicate help and supplemental trainign for students in SIS 600. If you know of current SIS grad students who would excel in this role, please send them my way!

### graduate coordinator
I oversee the graduate curriculum in research and professional methods in the School of International Service (all offerings under the SIS 600 and SIS 750 course numbers). In this role, I plan and schedule classes, develop new courses, and hire/supervise faculty. To date, I have planned and managed roughly 300 graduate classes in research methods.
