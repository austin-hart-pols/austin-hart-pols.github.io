  title={Unmasking Accountability: Judging Performance in an Interdependent World},
  author={Hart, Austin and Matthews, J. Scott},
  abstract={As local conditions come to reflect extralocal forces, signals of government competence grow more obscure. Yet we know relatively little about how voters evaluate incumbent performance in the context of interdependence. We use a series of simulated voting tasks to examine three theoretical possibilities: blind retrospection, rational discounting, and benchmarking. Across five experiments requiring “voters” to judge performance in a setting that obscures incumbent competence, we find consistent evidence of benchmarking—subjects rewarded incumbents, capable or otherwise, who outperformed a peer. Benchmarking was evident in information processing, information seeking, and both hard and easy tasks. The disposition to benchmark was also generally robust to the availability of information that clarified incumbent competence. Our findings advance the study of performance voting, especially its underlying mechanisms, and raise questions about the availability of performance information across domains of government action.},

  title={Priming under Fire: Reverse Causality and the Classic Media Priming Hypothesis},
  year={2014},
  number={2},
  pages={581-592},
  volume={76},
  abstract={This study reevaluates the classic "media priming" hypothesis, which argues that, when news coverage raises an issue’s salience, voters align their overall evaluation of the president with their assessment of him on that issue. Conventional studies typically show greater correspondence between issue approval and overall approval among individuals exposed to issue-related news. Although this is taken as evidence of media priming, this phenomenon is also consistent with another explanation. Precisely the opposite, the "projection" hypothesis argues that voters exposed to issue news align their approval of the president on that issue with their prior approval of his overall performance. Existing studies cannot rule out this alternative, so we conduct a survey experiment to evaluate the priming and projection hypotheses jointly. Despite recent evidence in support of projection, we show that the causal arrow runs from issue approval to overall approval (media priming), not the reverse (projection).},

  abstract = {Do electoral campaigns affect the strength of the economic vote? Against the conventional expectation that candidates have little influence over when and to what extent economic voting occurs, I argue that political communications systematically condition voters' willingness to hold candidates responsible for past economic performance. I test this priming-based approach against extant economic voting theory using data from Mexico’s 2000 and 2006 presidential elections, in which economic messages were absent and dominant respectively. The results show that candidates, by choosing to emphasize or deemphasize economic issues in their televised campaign ads, can activate and even deactivate economic considerations in the minds of voters. By bringing the priming approach to economic voting theory, I highlight the importance of communication strategy and demonstrate the power of campaigns to overcome structural conditions thought to hamstring electoral candidates},
